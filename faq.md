# Frequently Asked Questions

#### **Q:** How do I join the server?
#### **A:**
Simple! All you need to do is add `justminecraft.net` to your server list. If you get an error, make sure you typed it correctly.

#### **Q:** How do ranks work on survival/creative?
#### **A:** It's really simple!

- On JustCreative (`/creative`) ranking is really simple. Just type `/warp rankinfo` or `/spawn` and go up the staircase behind you. The formula is basically: place blocks + play time = rankup = more commands. You cannot rankup through money, you can only do it through hard work :). You can view your current progress with `/rank`, and you can see all the ranks with `/ranks`.

- On JustSurvival (`/survival`) ranking is even simpler. Type `/ranks` to view all the ranks, and `/rank` to see your current progress. You can earn more points by playing the game, and everytime you rankup you can `/sethome` two more homes. To vote type `/vote` and follow the links.

#### **Q:** How do I vote?
#### **A:** `/vote`

#### **Q:** How do I get started on JustCreative?
#### **A:**
First off, type `/p auto`. This will automatically claim an open plot, where you can start building. If you would like to let a friend build there just type `/p add <playername>`, or `/p remove <playname>`. If you don't want the player coming on your plot at all, do `/p deny <playname>` or `/p deny *` to deny everyone.

Once you rankup once, check out largeplots! Run `/warp lp` and then type `/p auto`. You then have a much larger plot to build in! To get back run `/warp sp` or `/spawn`. To get back to your plot type `/p h` or `/p h:<number>` for a specific plot.

#### **Q:** How do I claim blocks on JustSurvival?
#### **A:** 
Your days of the golden shovel are gone. All you need to do is place a block, and that block along with all the blocks next to it will be claimed automatically. There is no limit either!

<br>

#### **Q:** How can I let a player edit the blocks on my plot?
#### **A:** `/add <playname>` to add players, `/remove <playername>` to remove them

<br>

#### **Q:** Can I use my x-ray texture pack?
#### **A:** Oh man, this one is a toughie... uhh.... **No.**
