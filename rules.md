We don't like rules much, so let's keep it simple:

#### General
- Cursing is fine, but by default there is a chat filter. You can toggle it with `/nofilter`
- Abuse: it is not tolerated, and can result in a mute after one warning
- Threats: similar to abuse, it's also not tolerated. Smaller things, like telling someone that they are stupid/jerks/other things can result in a one hour mute, ruder things like telling someone to "kill themselves", "drink bleach", etc. can result in a once day ban. Threatening to kill someone, or DDOS them, or related will be a permaban.
- Griefing: surprise, it's not allowed! Depending on the severity, you will get a warning → one to three day ban → perma ban
- Inappropriate skins aren't allowed. You will get a warning → kick → one day ban (until you change your skin)


#### JustCreative
- Hacked clients are fine! But don't cheat with them, abuse their powers, etc. Also disable them in minigames.


#### JustSurvival
- Hacked client aren't fine ):, One warning, then a three day ban to a perma ban depending on the severity of the offense
- X-Ray is considered cheating, and has the same consequences as the bullet above.
