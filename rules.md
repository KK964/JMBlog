We don't like rules much, so let's keep it simple:

#### General
- Cursing is fine, but a chat filter may be turned on my default. You can toggle it with `/nofilter`
- Abuse: It is not tolerated, and can result in a mute after one warning, and escalate from there. This includes threats, profane insults, having the intention to annoy or make someone angry, being sadistic, and talking about controversial topics without minding other's opinions and experiences. Overall, be respectful and generally kind.
- No racism or any form of discrimination
- No spamming or excessive caps, it makes chat harder to read.
- No advertising other minecraft or discord servers.
- Common Sense: Just have some common sense. Please.
- Griefing: surprise, it's not allowed! Depending on the severity, you will get a warning → one to three day ban → seven day → perma ban
- Inappropriate skins or usernames aren't allowed. You will get a warning → kick → one day ban (until you change your skin/username)


#### JustCreative
- Only Creators+ Can go in freebuild. End of story, no exceptions.


#### JustSurvival
- Hacked clients are not OK, one warning, then a one day, seven day, then a perm ban. (Hacked clients are any clients that have been modified to provide an unfair gameplay advantage)
- X-Ray is considered cheating, and has the same consequences as the bullet above.
- Killing is allowed, but frowned upon, and so is combat-logging.
- If you /trust a player, you are taking responsibility for their actions, including if they ruin your base. A moderator may help you find out who griefed you, and may punish them, but your base will not be restored to normal.
- There are no grief protections on the main end island (the one with the dragon), do not build anything important there
